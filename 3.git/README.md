You may not need to work with Git on your first day, but as your models get more and more complex, you'll see the old convention of storing models start to struggle, well **Git** is your guardian angle!

- Creating a repository using Git
- Cloning a Git repository:
  - [Secure your account with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- Add, Commit and Push
- Pull, Fetch, Stash
- Fork, Pull Requests, Merges
- Reverts, Resets, Branches:
  - [Branching strategy](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/best-practices/git-branch-strategy)
- [Choosing the right License](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)

There are also many Git courses out there, like [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git), [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/git/index.htm) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git)

**Checkpoint #8**: Sign up in [GitHub](https://github.com/), create a repository and push your Reddit Scraper codes into your new repository.

**Checkpoint #9**: Try link your repository to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) so that changes you make in your GitHub repository are reflected in your Heroku! _...Getting iteresting huh?_

**Checkpoint #10**: Try and practice moer in [gitexercises](https://gitexercises.fracz.com/). Problems might get harder as your progress, but try go learn about the features Git offers, because they will come in handy.

_Final Note: Keep calm and hold tight to your **Git**!_
