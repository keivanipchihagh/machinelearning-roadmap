**Checkpoint #10**: At this point, you have followed the _See in Action_ parts of each library and you are good to go! I strongly recommand not to stop here and make yourself comfortable with these libraries, because they are the bulding blocks of everything from now on.

**Checkpoint #11**: You could alter your Reddit scraper bot to give your some numbers (likes, number of comments, votes, awards, etc.) and save them along side memes in Pandas. You can then do some analysis and visualization work!

### A Gentle Approach to Machine-Learning
> If you torture the data long enough, it will finally confess.

It's perfectly **okay** if what you are about to read sounds crazy and that you have no idea how some things work (and why they work!), but they will start to make sence after some time, hang tight!

#### Starting Off: 
- Official [scikit-learn tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html)
- Kaggle: [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
  - Splitting your data:

  - Scikit-Learn: [Cross-validate function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate.html)

By now, you probably have tons of questions and are panicing! Good, let's get into action and see how it's really done.

**Checkpoint #12**: _Compeition time with [Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)_! Explore the competition page, read [other's notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/code?competitionId=3136&sortBy=voteCount) (it's not cheating), create a notebook and start coding (lacking ideas? get help from other notebooks!). Submit your results (might have to try a few times to get it right). **Take your days and improve your code**!!!
