## Push-ups with Python
You can use any programming language you'd like, but _Python_ is the widest used language among Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. It's also super easy to master!

### Basics
- [Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp) and [Comments](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_comments.asp)
- [Data Types](https://realpython.com/courses/python-data-types/), [Variables](https://realpython.com/python-variables/) and more on [Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp):
  - [String formatting with f-string](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-guide-to-string-formatting-in-python-using-f-strings-39e5c39589c3)
- [Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp) and [Sets](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp)
- [Dictionary](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary)
- [Functions](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function)
- [Flow Control (If-Else, Loops, ...)](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/if-elif-else)
- Working with files:
  - [Basic file-operations](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-operation)
  - [Working with JSON Data](https://realpython.com/python-json/)
  - [YAML: The Missing Battery in Python](https://realpython.com/python-yaml/)

Mini-Project: Solve as many problems as you can in [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) and put your skills at use!
### Intermediate
- Working with Web:
  - [Python Requests](https://realpython.com/python-requests/)
  - [Beautiful Soup for Web-Scraping](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-python-using-beautiful-soup/)
- [Multithreading and Multiprocessing](https://towardsdatascience.com/multithreading-multiprocessing-python-180d0975ab29)
- [Object Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Overloading, Special Methods, Properties, ...)](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-oop/)
- [Regular Expression (Regex)](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/regex)
- [Decorators](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-decorators-explained-with-examples/)
- [Unit-Testing](https://realpython.com/python-testing/)

### Advanced
- [Keep calm and write logs](https://realpython.com/python-logging/) and even more [logs](https://machinelearningmastery.com/logging-in-python/)!
- [Write docs the proper way (Google style)](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
- [Manage your packages with PIP](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp)
- [Set up Virtual Environment to isolate your project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
- [Use Environmental Varaibles with _python-dotenv_](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
- [Structuring your application](https://realpython.com/python-application-layouts/)
- Interactive notebooks:
  - Run your code locally: [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
  - Run your code online: [Google Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/)


I suggest going through a few whole tutorials to build up a solid background on Python, like with [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) or [pythontutorial](https://www.pythontutorial.net/).

## Version Control with Git
> "The problem with git jokes is that everyone has their own version."
- Got with courses out there, like [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git), [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/git/index.htm) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git)
- [Branching strategy](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/best-practices/git-branch-strategy)
- [More secure with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
