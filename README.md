A roadmap to learn Machine-Learning and ML-Ops

## Warming Up with Python
Start with a few push-ups first:
### Pure Python:
- Syntax: [Intraction](https://realpython.com/interacting-with-python/), [Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp) and [Comments](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_comments.asp)
- Data Types: [Data Types](https://realpython.com/courses/python-data-types/), [Variables](https://realpython.com/python-variables/) and specially [Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)
- Data Structures: [Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp), [Sets](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp) and [Dictionary](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary)
- Functions: [Functions](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function) and [Lambda](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp)
- [Flow Control (If-Else, Loops, ...)](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/if-elif-else)
- [Working with Files & Exception Handling](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-operation)
- [Object Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Overloading, Special Methods, Properties, ...)](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-oop/)
- [Decorators](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-decorators-explained-with-examples/)
- [Iterators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_iterators.asp)
- [Regular Expression (Regex)](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/regex)
- Working with Files: [Working with File](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp) and [Work with JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp)

I suggest going through a few whole tutorials to build up a solid background on Python, like with [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) or [pythontutorial](https://www.pythontutorial.net/). Also remember to solve as many problems as you can in [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) to keep fit for the action!

### Get yur Hands dirty:
- [PIP Packaging](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp)
- [Setting up Virtual Environment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
- [Using Environmental Variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41546883/what-is-the-use-of-python-dotenv)
- [Project Structure](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/)
