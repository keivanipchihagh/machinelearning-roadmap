A roadmap to learn Machine-Learning and ML-Ops

## Warming Up with Python
Start with a few push-ups first:
### Pure Python:
- [_Hello World!_](https://realpython.com/interacting-with-python/)
- [Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp) and [Comments](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_comments.asp)
- [Data Types](https://realpython.com/courses/python-data-types/), [Variables](https://realpython.com/python-variables/) and more on [Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)
- [Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp) and [Sets](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp)
- [Dictionary](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary)
- [Functions](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function)
- [Flow Control (If-Else, Loops, ...)](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/if-elif-else)
- [Working with Files & Exception Handling](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-operation)
- [Object Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Overloading, Special Methods, Properties, ...)](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-oop/)
- [Regular Expression (Regex)](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/regex)
- [Decorators](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-decorators-explained-with-examples/)

### Get more Practical
- [Work with JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp)
- [PIP Packaging](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp)
- [Setting up Virtual Environment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)


I suggest going through a few whole tutorials to build up a solid background on Python, like with [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) or [pythontutorial](https://www.pythontutorial.net/).
