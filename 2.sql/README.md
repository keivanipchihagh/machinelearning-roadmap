# SQL is your friend
> A SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks: "Mind if I join you?"

SQL is the backbone of databases and as a Data Scientist, you get to work with a lot of complex queries which can and will blow your mind. Better come prepared...

- [Basics](https://www.sqlcourse.com/beginner-course/): Select, Create, Insert, Update, Delete or Drop
  - [Aliases](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp)
  - [Where](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp) - Conditions
  - Kaggle: [Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql)
- [Intermediate](https://www.sqlcourse.com/advanced-course/): Aggregate, Group By, Having, Order By and Joins
  - Aggregations: Count, Sum, Avg
  - [Joins](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sql-joins-tutorial/): Inner Join, Outer Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Join, Self Join, Union (Read more [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/sql-joins-tutorial/))
  - Kaggle: [Advanced SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql)
- Advanced:
  - [Wildcards](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_wildcards.asp) and [Like](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp)
  - [SQL Injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) in [Action](https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/sql-injection#/start)
  - [Auto Increment](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_autoincrement.asp)
  - [Index](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-indexes/) - To speed up your query!
  - Choose an engine: [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/), [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/), [SQL-Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), etc.
- Off Topic: SQL doesn't end anywhere near here! There are many more advanced topics like [Views](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-views/), [Procedures](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-stored-procedures/), [Functions](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-user-defined-functions/), [Triggers](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-triggers/) and a lot more. You can learn them if you want, but they are not something a _Data Scientiest_ should worry about (hopefully!).


**Checkpoint #6**: Head to courses [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql) and [sqlservertutorial](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net) for more practice. You know SQL commands in theory, but let's see how you can perform in practice.. go [here](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/sql/exercises/standard/).

**Checkpoint #7**: Connect your python to a Database (I suggest, postgresql - see [how](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_python.htm)) and scrape lots of memes of Reddit and store them into your database; then alter your Bot to read the memes from database instead of scraping each time.

_Final Note: You've learned the basics of SQL syntax by now, but you've got lots of work to do. Don't worry if you haven't got it all sorted out, you'll learn more SQL when you feel the need_
